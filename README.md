# Data Insights from Aadhaar A Comprehensive Analysis using Qlik
 Data Analytics Project based on Aadhar

## Project Description:
This project provides information on the patterns in the number of Aadhars created and the reasons why certain states in India reject Aadhar enrollments. Additionally, it offers information on the number of Aadhar cards that are generated in different Districts and Sub-District in India. Additionally, it gives us information about the amount of people who offer their email address and mobile number when creating an Aadhar, as well as insights into which registrars or enrollment agencies are creating the most Aadhars. This project's goal is to analyse the intensity with which Indian States are generating Aadhar for the country's citizens, as well as the commitment with which different registrars and enrollment agencies are pursuing this goal. Additionally, analysis of the distribution of men and women involved in the Aadhar generation process is provided by this initiative, along with information on the various age groups actively participating in the process. With the use of these insights, we may pinpoint the different states where the process is sluggish or identify which enrollments are being turned down from a specific region, both of which will contribute to the process's smooth running. It would also assist us in determining which enrollment agencies and registrars are ineffective and replacing them with new ones who are more committed to their project.
